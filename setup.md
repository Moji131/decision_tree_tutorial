| Compute Size                             | small                     |
| Project                                  | cd82                      |

Then click the Launch button.

This will take you to your interactive session page you will see that that your JupyterLab session is Queued while ARE is searching for a compute node that will satisfy your requirements.

Once found, the page will update with a button that you can click to Open JupyterLab.

Here is a screenshot of a JupyterLab landing page that should be similar to the one that opens in your web browser after starting the JupyterLab server on either macOS or Windows.
